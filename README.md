truly a fucking awful type of assignment. its a shame how little time you're given to deeply study a syntax and the conceptual workflow
that will later on follow you for years of hard work in an already incredibly highly-competitive enviroment. when you get an insane amount of assignments to complete within a tiny window of time 
post the AI - revolution, you cause students of all levels to "cheat" without an alternative. I don't like cheating, I wanna know everything I'm presented and I wanna feel good presenting my
assignments without having to get grades for the work I didn't do, I didn't learn from, and I didn't bust my ass with sweat, tears, and blood to achieve a higher understanding of the subject
matters. so that's all there is- more projects like this, forcing you to study alone, forcing you to do a shit tone of work with a small window of time and forcing you to cheat.
fuck all of that.
